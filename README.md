* [https://github.com/keon/deep-q-learning/blob/master/dqn.py](https://github.com/keon/deep-q-learning/blob/master/dqn.py)

#### How to run
```
cd Homework_Assignment_Week5/dqn/
python dqn.py
```

### A2C

This solution is based on:
* Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On by Maxim Lapan  
  [https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/deep-reinforcement-learning-hands](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/deep-reinforcement-learning-hands)

Chapter 14 & Chapter 15:
* Continuous Action Space, The Actor-Critic (A2C) method
* Trust Regions â€“ TRPO, PPO, and ACKTR

#### How to run
```
cd Homework_Assignment_Week5/a2c/
python 01_train_a2c.py --name bipedal --cuda
python 02_play.py --model saves/a2c-bipedal/<<your data file>>.dat --save 45
